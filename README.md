## Expense Tracker

This is a simple Expense Tracker app that allows users to add and manage their expenses in a clear and organized manner.

With an easy-to-use interface, users can input the type, name, date, and amount of an expense, and then add it to the table by clicking the "Add a new expense" button.
If needed you can also delete a single row with the "Delete an Expense" button.
The table displays all added expenses in a neat and structured format, making it convenient for users to keep track of their expenditures.

Once you add in all the informatino all you have to do is click the "Add a New Expense" button and the place holder will be removed and replaced with a new row that contains all the information the user placed as shown below.

Any number of rows of information can be added as well. 

If you wish to delete a single row just click the "Delete an Expense" button. Keep pressing it to delete other rows if need be.

This will be my fourth JavaScript Project as of now.

HTML structure: The app includes input elements for selecting the expense type, providing a name and amount, and picking a date, as well as a button for adding the expense to the table. The table consists of columns for the type, name, date, and amount, with rows dynamically generated to display the user's entered expenses.

CSS styling: The app's appearance is controlled by CSS, including styles for the layout, colors, and fonts. The table container and other elements have appropriate classes that set their display, alignment, background color, width, and positioning.

JavaScript functionality: The app relies on JavaScript to handle user interactions, such as adding expenses to the table and managing the input data. It utilizes DOM manipulation to create, modify, and display expense information based on user input.

The app's functionality is centered around extracting user inputs, storing them in arrays, and dynamically generating table rows to display the added expenses in an organized manner. The code is structured with a combination of global variables and functions that handle data extraction, table updates, and other essential tasks.
